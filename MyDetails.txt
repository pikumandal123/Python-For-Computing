Hi there!, I'm Saptarshi Mandal, a final year PhD candidate in the department of 
Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Oklahoma.
My research interest involves developing novel analysis frameworks (both quantitative and qualitative) 
to solve issues in complex human-integrated systems. In detail, I'm very much interested in 
leveraging the power of Data Analytics and Machine Learning to evaluate and optimize systems where
Human beings are an integral part, e.g. Air traffic control, Industrial safety etc.
